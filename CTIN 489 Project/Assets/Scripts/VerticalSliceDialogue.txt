[Intro]
I guess this window looks pretty dirty, I should probably clean it

[Window1]
You: This person seems to have really neglected this…
NPC: "Thank you for doing this!"
NPC: "You’re always so helpful!"

[Window1Fin]
You: Oh wow, I haven’t seen Teddy in ages
You: I still remember when her daughter asked for it
You: I mean how could I say no!
NPC: "Wow the window looks perfect!"
NPC: "I think the cafe owner also needed their window cleaned..."
You: "Ah, ok! I will be right on that!"

[Window2]
You: Why do people always vandalize...
You: It makes my life so much harder
Cafe Owner: "Sorry.. I need to keep better watch."
You: "No worries!"
You: "It keeps me in business I guess"

[Window2Fin]
You: Oh wow, that looks really fun.
You: I wish I could've joined my friends..
You: But they invited me after I already started work.

[Tree]
You: I think that water drop is stuck in that tree
You: Maybe if I could shake it? [E]
